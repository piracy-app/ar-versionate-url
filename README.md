focusing on the data / URL update issue i develop "AR versionate URL"

You can deploy "Main Route/URL" that will be use for you app/data, this will generate the Main URL

after you create the "Router" you can add a arweave data url  , and now the "Main Route" will redirect to the the new url


When we deploy the "Main Route" , we upload a simple app that will call arweave network and redirect to the newest url available in the query. For query requirements the simple app is deploy with a few parameters:
Id: we generate a unique id that identifies the app
deployer address: we store the address of the user that deploy the app

with this two parameters the deployed app can search and get the latest url available registered by the same address that deploy the main route
